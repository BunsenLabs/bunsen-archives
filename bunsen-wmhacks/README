#############################################################

Scripts for adding hot corners and aero style window snapping
to Openbox.
Based on cb-wmhacks, written for CrunchBang Linux.
Repackaged for BunsenLabs Linux.

### bl-hotcorner usage:

This script is designed to be started automatically on login via
Openbox's autostart file:

    # Start hotcorner detection:
    bl-hotcorners --daemon &

Once started, the script will detect when the mouse cursor enters
the corners of your screen. If the corner has an associated command,
it will get executed.

#### Command line usage:

    bl-hotcorners: usage:
        --help          show this message and exit
        --kill          attempt to kill any running instances
        --daemon        run daemon and listen for cursor triggers

#### Customising commands:

On first use, a config file will be created
`~/.config/bl-hotcorners/bl-hotcornersrc`. The file should be
self-explanatory.

### bl-aerosnap usage:

This script is designed to be called via Openbox keyboard shortucts.
Edit Openbox's rc.xml file to add new shortcuts. Example shortcuts to
bind snapping to Super+Alt+Left/Right key combinations:

    <keybind key="W-A-Left">
        <action name="Execute">
            <command>bl-aerosnap --left</command>
        </action>
    </keybind>
    <keybind key="W-A-Right">
        <action name="Execute">
            <command>bl-aerosnap --right</command>
        </action>
    </keybind>

#### Command line usage:

    bl-aerosnap: usage:
        --help          show this message and exit
        --left          attempt to snap active window to left of screen
        --right         attempt to snap active window to right of screen
